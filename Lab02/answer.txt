Q: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
A: Yes, Java allows you to do this through constructor overloading. In Java, you can create multiple constructors within the same class as long as each constructor has a different parameter list.
